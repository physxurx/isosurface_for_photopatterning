# isosurface_for_photopatterning
This program generates a 2D array of alternating ±1/2 vortices (defects), computes their orientation (director) field, and visualizes both the grid structure and isosurfaces of the azimuthal angle. It can be interpreted as a visualization of nematic liquid crystal defects arranged in a periodic lattice.
